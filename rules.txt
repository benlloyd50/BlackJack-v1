    Rules of Blackjack
    -One player, you against the house 
    -Get to 21 without going over, pretty simple

    Each round this happens:
    -One card is dealt to the player, then dealer face up
    -Second card is dealt to player, then dealer but face down
    -Take a hit or stand

    ==Dealer's logic
        ==After you stand, dealer will start taking cards
        ==If under 17 total, dealer will hit again

    ==Ace Card Logic
        ==Calculate two values with 1 and 11

    Win/Lose Conditions:
    -Win: You hit 21 OR your cards are equal to MORE than the dealers
    -Lose: You hit over 21 OR your cards are equal to LESS than the dealers
    
    Future considerations:
    -Betting
    -Implementing the rest of the special cases and rules in casino play
    -**Possibility for multiplayer in future hehe
